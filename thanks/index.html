            <p>On March 11, 2020, Emory University made the difficult decision of transitioning to remote learning for all graduate and undergraduate classes based on the developments of the coronavirus (COVID-19). They extended spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, allowing students time to gather their belongings and adjust to their new living conditions for the remainder of the semester.</p>
            <p>The administration, faculty, and student leaders immediately got to work on addressing all of our concerns involving classes, textbooks, housing, financial aid, health insurance, reimbursements, academic advising, transportation, etc. Professors began adjusting their course schedules to accommodate all students and their needs across the world. Many student leaders on campus began offering their support and resources as well. Many student organizations began hosting virtual events and activities to keep students engaged. </p>
            <p>It is amazing how smooth the Emory administration, faculty, and student leaders have made this process given the extenuating circumstances. Many students have mentioned wanting to find a way to show their gratitude and appreciation for the Emory community for putting their students first and trying to address all of our concerns and needs. This website has been created to provide this opportunity - please fill out the short form using the link below to tell our community what you are most thankful for during this pandemic. Feel free to share any personal stories you may have as well! </p>
            <p>To all Emory administration, faculty, and leaders reading these messages, please know that we are extremely grateful to be going to a university that puts its students first! Thank you so much ðŸ™‚ <a href="https://forms.gle/dhhkD3MC5CncVuhC6">Add your thank you card here.</a></p>
